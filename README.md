# NYC_Crime_Project
These scripts use the pandas library to merge NYC crime datasets for use in a larger project. 

Two of the scripts clean individual datasets downloaded from OpenNYC

The third script combines the two cleaned datasets into one csv file

NOTE: One of the files is large (~2GB) so it takes a minute or two for the scripts to run
